# OS Simulator (Task Scheduler Simulator & Synchronization Problems Solver)

This project is a comprehensive simulation and solution provider for various task scheduling algorithms, synchronization problems, disk scheduling algorithms, and page replacement algorithms. It includes functionalities for user authentication, CRUD operations, and interactive visualizations.

## Features

### Task Scheduler Simulations

- **Shortest Job First (SJF) Algorithm**
  - Simulates task scheduling using the SJF algorithm.
  - Displays results with a Gantt chart for visualization.

### Synchronization Problems

- **Dining Philosophers Problem**
  - Implements synchronization solution to avoid deadlock and starvation.

### Disk Scheduling

- **C-Look Algorithm**
  - Simulates disk scheduling using the C-Look algorithm.

### Page Replacement

- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Algorithm**
  - Implements page replacement using the FIFO algorithm.

### User Management

- **User Authentication**
  - Secure user login and registration using sessions.

- **CRUD Operations**
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for tasks and other entities.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for client-side interactions.
- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **Session Management**: Handling user sessions securely.
